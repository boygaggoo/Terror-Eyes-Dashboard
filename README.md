# Terror Eyes
Terror Eyes is designed to be an immediate response system to proactively deal with terrorist threats, by providing timely and actionable information to authorities in the immediate wake of an attack. It was built as an interactive dashboard using the Flask microframework, and was a major part of our Analytics solution for the [Teradata University Network Challenge](http://www.teradatauniversitynetwork.com/PARTNERS2016/2016-TUN-Analytics-Challenge/). 

By leveraging information from previous terror attacks (courtesy of the [GTD](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/)), we have developed a predictive model to probabilistically determine the most likely perpetrator behind any terror attack. We can then use that information to predict if the attack would be followed up by subsequent ones, and if so, generalize the modus operandi of the perpetrators. This will enable us to provide useful information to authorities, such as the most likely mode of attack, whether a hostage situation is likely etc.
